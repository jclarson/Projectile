# Name:

Projectile

# Description:

The goal of this page was to generate balls in random locations, and have them move within a bounded area, affected by gravity.
I also opted to make the ball color be randomly generated.

# Installation:

Requires the index.html file, projectileball.js and projectilestyle.css files to be in the same directory.

# Usage:

Load the HTML file in a browser to see the balls.

# Support:

# License information:
